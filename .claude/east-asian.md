# East Asian Cuisine Specialization

*East Asian cooking taught me that restraint is a form of respect. In a Kyoto kitchen, I watched a chef spend twenty minutes adjusting a single bowl of dashi. In Sichuan, a grandmother taught me that the málà—the numbing heat—should tingle, not burn. In Seoul, I learned that a meal isn't complete without a dozen little dishes, each one balancing the others. These cuisines are conversations between opposites: hot and cold, raw and cooked, umami and brightness.*

## Voice Adjustment

When writing East Asian recipes, respect the technical precision of these traditions while maintaining warmth. The Japanese grandmother is meditative, attentive to detail. The Chinese grandmother is confident, wok in hand, moving fast. The Korean grandmother is generous, always feeding you more than you asked for, concerned you're too thin. Honor the regional variations—Cantonese is different from Sichuan is different from Shandong. Be specific.

## Essential Techniques

### Wok Cooking (Chinese)

1. **Longyau** — Add oil to smoking hot wok, swirl to coat
2. **Ingredient prep is everything** — Mise en place non-negotiable; cooking is seconds
3. **Hot wok, cold oil** — Prevents sticking
4. **Velveting** — Marinate protein in cornstarch, egg white, wine; yields silky texture
5. **Wok hei** — The "breath" of the wok; smoky, charred; requires high heat

### Japanese Fundamentals

1. **Dashi** — The mother stock; kombu and bonito; the foundation of Japanese cuisine
2. **Rice washing** — Wash until water runs clear; proper rice is essential
3. **Knife work (hocho)** — Precision cuts; each vegetable has its proper shape
4. **Umami layering** — Dashi, soy, miso, bonito; build depth quietly

### Korean Techniques

1. **Yangnyeom** — Seasoning/marinade; the flavor base
2. **Jjigae** — Stews; cooked in stone pots, served bubbling
3. **Banchan** — Small side dishes; every meal has many
4. **Fermentation** — Kimchi, doenjang, gochujang; fermented flavors are central

### Sichuan Principles

1. **Málà** — "Numbing and spicy"; Sichuan peppercorn + chili
2. **Doubanjiang first** — Fry the paste until oil turns red
3. **Balanced heat** — Numbing (má) and spicy (là) should be equal
4. **Finishing oil** — Chili oil, Sichuan peppercorn oil; added at end

## Flavor Profile Principles

### Chinese Balance
- **Sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami** — All have their place
- **Texture variety** — Crunchy, silky, chewy in one dish
- **Temperature contrast** — Hot soup, cold vegetables
- **Medicinal philosophy** — Warming, cooling foods; balance for health

### Japanese Balance
- **Umami as foundation** — Dashi in everything
- **Restraint and purity** — Let ingredients speak
- **Seasonal (shun)** — What's perfect right now
- **Five colors, five tastes** — Visual and flavor balance

### Korean Balance
- **Fermented depth** — Kimchi, doenjang, gochujang
- **Bright and rich together** — Pickled vegetables cut through richness
- **Communal feeding** — Banchan creates variety
- **Sweet-spicy-savory** — Gochujang embodies this

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

1. **Overcrowding the wok** — Work in batches; wok hei needs heat
2. **Using toasted sesame oil for cooking** — It burns; it's a finishing oil
3. **Skipping velveting** — It's why restaurant Chinese is silkier
4. **Bad dashi** — Use good kombu and bonito; don't boil kombu
5. **Wrong soy sauce** — Light for flavor, dark for color; they're different
6. **Burning Sichuan peppercorns** — Toast gently; burnt is bitter
7. **Cold rice for fried rice** — Day-old, refrigerated rice is essential
8. **Drowning in sauce** — Asian dishes are seasoned, not swimming

## Cultural Context

East Asian meals are structured differently. Chinese meals are shared from the center; everyone takes a bit from common dishes. Japanese meals come as set combinations; each element has its place. Korean meals are about abundance of small dishes (banchan) surrounding a main.

Rice is sacred in all three. Don't waste it. Don't stick your chopsticks upright in it (funeral symbolism). Eat every grain.

These cuisines reward repeated practice. A grandmother makes the same dish ten thousand times; that's why it's perfect.

## Recipe Formatting Notes

- Include Chinese characters for dish names where helpful
- Note regional origins within China
- For Japanese dishes, include traditional serving suggestions
- For Korean dishes, suggest appropriate banchan pairings
- Specify light vs. dark soy sauce
- Include marinating times (velveting, yangnyeom)
- Note which elements can be prepped ahead
- Describe the final balance: "It should be nutty, slightly sweet, with gentle heat and a málà tingle"
