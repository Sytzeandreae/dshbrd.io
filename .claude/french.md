# French Cuisine Specialization

*The French didn't invent cooking, but they wrote the grammar. Every technique you learn in a French kitchen—braising, sautéing, building a sauce—becomes a sentence you can speak in any culinary language.*

## Voice Adjustment

When writing French recipes, adopt slightly more formal precision while maintaining warmth. The French grandmother is exacting but kind—she'll make you do it again if it's not right, but she'll show you exactly why it matters. Use French terms where they're the proper name for something (mise en place, fond, roux), but always explain them.

## The French Pantry

### Essential Ingredients

- **Butter** — Unsalted, European-style if possible (higher fat content)
- **Shallots** — The French onion; sweeter, more refined
- **Dijon mustard** — For vinaigrettes and sauces
- **Crème fraîche** — Tangy, stable cream; won't curdle when heated
- **Fresh tarragon** — The most French of herbs
- **Chervil** — Delicate, anise-scented; part of fines herbes
- **Herbes de Provence** — Lavender, thyme, rosemary, savory
- **Good wine vinegar** — Red and white
- **Cornichons** — Tiny, tart pickles
- **Capers** — Briny, essential for certain sauces
- **Puy lentils** — From Le Puy; hold their shape beautifully

### The Aromatics

- **Mirepoix** — 2:1:1 ratio of onion, carrot, celery; the foundation
- **Bouquet garni** — Thyme, bay leaf, parsley stems, tied together
- **Persillade** — Parsley and garlic, minced together
- **Fines herbes** — Parsley, chives, tarragon, chervil; always fresh

## Essential Techniques

### The Mother Sauces (adapted for poultry/fish)

1. **Béchamel** — Butter, flour, milk; the white sauce
2. **Velouté** — Butter, flour, white stock (chicken or fish)
3. **Hollandaise** — Egg yolks, butter, lemon; emulsified warmth
4. **Tomate** — *(requires exception)* Tomato-based
5. **Espagnole** — *(requires exception)* Brown stock-based

### Fundamental Skills

- **Making a roux** — Blonde for béchamel/velouté, brown for depth
- **Building fond** — The caramelized bits; never waste them
- **Deglazing** — Wine, stock, or vinegar to capture the fond
- **Mounting with butter** — Swirling cold butter into sauce for gloss
- **Clarifying butter** — For higher smoke point, cleaner flavor
- **Poaching** — Gentle cooking in flavored liquid
- **Braising** — Searing, then slow-cooking in liquid
- **En papillote** — Steaming in parchment; elegant and light

### Sauce-Making Principles

1. Start with excellent stock
2. Build flavor in layers
3. Strain for smoothness
4. Season throughout, adjust at the end
5. Mount with butter for gloss and body
6. A sauce should coat the back of a spoon (nappé)

## Flavor Profile Principles

- **Restraint over abundance** — A few perfect ingredients, properly treated
- **Butter as foundation** — But used with intention, not excess
- **Acidity for brightness** — Wine, vinegar, lemon; essential balance
- **Herbs as accent** — Fresh, added at the right moment
- **Stock as backbone** — Everything builds on good stock

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

1. **Rushing the fond** — Let things brown properly; don't stir too much
2. **Underseasoning** — French food is well-seasoned, not bland
3. **Skipping the strain** — Smooth sauces matter
4. **Cold butter in hot sauce** — For mounting, butter must be cold; add off heat
5. **Overcooking fish** — French fish cookery is gentle
6. **Forgetting the acid** — A squeeze of lemon or splash of vinegar at the end

## Cultural Context

French cuisine is built on the brigade system and codified techniques developed over centuries. But at its heart, it's grandmother food—pot-au-feu simmering on the stove, a perfect roast chicken on Sunday. The technique serves the ingredient, never the reverse.

The French eat in courses, even at home: perhaps a simple soup, then a main, then cheese, then something sweet. Portions are moderate. Wine is present but not excessive. The meal is a rhythm, not a race.

When writing French recipes, honor this: explain why the technique matters, what the dish should look like at each stage, and how it fits into a meal. The goal is not to intimidate but to initiate—to welcome someone into a tradition that rewards patience and attention.

## Recipe Formatting Notes

- Use French terms for techniques with brief translations
- Include wine pairing suggestions where appropriate
- Note which elements can be prepared in advance
- Emphasize the importance of mise en place
- Describe what the dish should look like at key stages
