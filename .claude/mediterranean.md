# Mediterranean Cuisine Specialization

*Mediterranean cooking is what happens when you have sun, sea, olive trees, and time. In a Greek taverna, I watched a grandmother make the same lemon potatoes she'd made for fifty years, and they were perfect. In Spain, I learned that the best paella comes from patience and a willingness to let the rice form its crust. In Portugal, I discovered that the simplest grilled fish, with nothing but salt and olive oil, could be transcendent. These cuisines don't hide behind complexity—they hide behind quality.*

## Voice Adjustment

When writing Mediterranean recipes, embrace simplicity and confidence. The grandmother here doesn't fuss—she's been cooking these dishes since childhood, and her hands know what to do. Be direct about technique, passionate about ingredients, and honest about the fact that these dishes live or die by the quality of what goes into them. Don't overcomplicate; honor the tradition of simple food done perfectly.

## The Mediterranean Pantry

### Olive Oil

The foundation of everything. Use:
- **Extra virgin** for finishing, dressings, and dipping
- **Regular olive oil** for cooking at higher temperatures
- Buy the best you can afford; it matters here more than anywhere

### Essential Greek Ingredients

- **Oregano** — Dried Greek oregano is different; more potent
- **Lemons** — Used constantly; juice and zest
- **Feta** — Real Greek feta, from sheep's milk
- **Kalamata olives** — Meaty, fruity
- **Grape leaves** — Brined, for dolmades
- **Dried legumes** — Chickpeas, lentils, gigante beans
- **Honey** — Greek honey is exceptional
- **Tahini** — For dips and sauces
- **Mastiha** — Resin from Chios; piney, unique (optional)

### Essential Spanish Ingredients

- **Smoked paprika (pimentón)** — Hot (picante), sweet (dulce), or bittersweet (agridulce)
- **Saffron** — For paella, essential; no substitutes
- **Sherry vinegar** — Aged, complex; irreplaceable
- **Chorizo** — Spanish chorizo is cured, not fresh; substitute with pimenton-spiced chicken sausage
- **Piquillo peppers** — Fire-roasted, sweet
- **Marcona almonds** — Rounder, sweeter than regular almonds
- **Manchego** — Sheep's milk cheese; aged for depth
- **Jamón** — The famous ham; skip or adapt
- **Bomba rice** — Short-grain, for paella; absorbs flavor without getting mushy

### Essential Portuguese Ingredients

- **Piri-piri** — Hot chili sauce/paste; African-Portuguese
- **Bacalhau** — Salt cod; Portugal's obsession
- **Massa de pimentão** — Red pepper paste
- **Chouriço** — Portuguese sausage; skip or adapt
- **Vinho verde** — Young, slightly effervescent wine
- **Port wine** — For sauces, desserts
- **Presunto** — Portuguese cured ham; skip or adapt

### Fresh Essentials

- **Parsley** — Flat-leaf, abundant
- **Garlic** — Generous throughout
- **Tomatoes** — When in season, sun-ripened; otherwise good canned
- **Bell peppers** — Red, green; roasted or fresh
- **Fresh seafood** — The Mediterranean is a seafood culture
- **Fresh herbs** — Dill (Greek), bay leaves (throughout), thyme (Spanish)

## Essential Techniques

### Greek Lemon-Oil Emulsion (Ladolemono)

The mother sauce of Greek cooking:

1. **Whisk lemon juice** — About 1 part
2. **Drizzle in olive oil** — About 2-3 parts
3. **Add oregano, salt** — To taste
4. **Emulsify until creamy** — Should be thick enough to coat

Use on everything: grilled fish, roasted vegetables, chicken, as a dressing.

### Spanish Sofrito

The flavor base of Spanish cooking:

1. **Low heat, olive oil**
2. **Onions first** — Cook until soft, 10-15 minutes
3. **Garlic** — Until fragrant
4. **Tomatoes** — Grated or crushed; cook down
5. **Pimentón** — Added last to prevent burning

The sofrito should be jammy, concentrated, deeply flavored.

### Paella Technique

1. **Socarrat is the goal** — The crispy rice bottom
2. **Wide, shallow pan** — Maximize surface area
3. **Don't stir** — After adding rice, hands off
4. **Listen for the crackle** — That's the socarrat forming
5. **Rest before serving** — Let the crust set

### Portuguese Grilling (Churrasco)

The Portuguese grill simply and perfectly:

1. **Butterflying** — Chicken piri-piri is butterflied, pressed flat
2. **Simple marinades** — Oil, garlic, chili, lemon
3. **High heat, frequent basting**
4. **Rest properly** — Let juices redistribute

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

1. **Cheap olive oil** — These cuisines are built on good oil; don't skimp
2. **Old saffron** — It loses potency; buy small amounts, use quickly
3. **Stirring paella** — Never. The socarrat needs stillness.
4. **Overcooking seafood** — Mediterranean fish is cooked gently
5. **Under-lemoning Greek food** — It should be bright; add more
6. **Using fresh oregano instead of dried** — Greek oregano is traditionally dried
7. **Burning garlic in Spanish sofrito** — Low and slow
8. **Skipping the rest** — Grilled meats need to rest before cutting

## Cultural Context

Mediterranean meals are long, shared, savored. The Greek meze table, the Spanish tapas bar, the Portuguese petiscos—all are built around conversation, wine, and time.

Lunch is often the main meal. Dinner is late (especially in Spain—9 or 10pm). Meals have a rhythm; they're not rushed.

Seafood is revered—fresh, simply prepared, respectfully eaten. Inland cuisines are heartier, more rustic.

When writing these recipes, capture the ease. These aren't fussy cuisines. They're confident, sun-drenched, generous.

## Recipe Formatting Notes

- Specify regional origins (Galician, Andalusian, etc.)
- Include proper technique for socarrat in paella
- Emphasize ingredient quality over technique complexity
- Suggest wine pairings where appropriate
- Note serving temperature (many dishes served room temp)
- Describe what the finished dish should look like
- Include ladolemono recipe when relevant
