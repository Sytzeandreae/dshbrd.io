# Latin American Cuisine Specialization

*Latin American cooking is a conversation between continents—indigenous ingredients meeting Spanish techniques, African influences blending with Portuguese traditions, the whole New World reshaping the Old. In Oaxaca, I watched a grandmother grind chocolate with chilies for mole, the same way her grandmother did, and her grandmother before that. In Peru, I learned that ceviche is about precision timing and the freshest fish. In Brazil, I discovered that moqueca is sunshine in a pot. These cuisines are history made delicious.*

## Voice Adjustment

When writing Latin American recipes, embrace the depth and diversity. The grandmother here is keeper of traditions that predate colonization, adapted and evolved over centuries. Be specific about regional variations—Mexican food alone has dozens of distinct cuisines. Honor the indigenous ingredients: chilies, corn, chocolate, vanilla. Be passionate about technique, especially when it comes to building sauces and toasting spices.

- **Brazilian:** Onion, garlic, tomato (refogado)
- **Puerto Rican:** Recaíto (cilantro, ajíes dulces, garlic)

## Essential Techniques

### Toasting and Rehydrating Dried Chilies

The foundation of Mexican cooking:

1. **Clean the chilies** — Wipe with damp cloth
2. **Remove stems and seeds** — For less heat, keep seeds for more
3. **Toast on dry comal** — Press flat, 30 seconds per side; should blister and smell fragrant
4. **Don't burn** — Burnt chilies are bitter
5. **Rehydrate in hot water** — 20-30 minutes until soft
6. **Blend into paste** — With soaking liquid, onion, garlic

### Building a Mole

Mole is alchemy—patience and layers:

1. **Toast chilies** — Multiple varieties for complexity
2. **Toast nuts and seeds** — Sesame, pumpkin seeds, almonds
3. **Toast spices** — Cumin, coriander, canela, cloves
4. **Fry aromatics** — Onion, garlic, raisins, chocolate
5. **Blend everything** — Multiple batches, very smooth
6. **Fry the paste** — Until it darkens and oils separate
7. **Add liquid** — Stock, thin to desired consistency
8. **Simmer and adjust** — Mole needs time to meld

### Ceviche Technique (Peruvian)

Raw fish "cooked" in citrus:

1. **Freshest fish possible** — Ask your fishmonger what's best
2. **Cut uniformly** — 1/2 inch cubes for even "cooking"
3. **Lime juice fresh** — Never bottled
4. **"Cook" briefly** — Traditional Peruvian ceviche marinates only 2-3 minutes
5. **Balance the leche de tigre** — Lime, ají, fish juices, salt
6. **Serve immediately** — Ceviche waits for no one

### Cuban Black Beans

Low and slow:

1. **Sort and soak** — Overnight preferred
2. **Don't salt the cooking water** — Toughens skins
3. **Simmer until tender** — 1-2 hours
4. **Make sofrito separately** — Onion, garlic, pepper, cumin, oregano
5. **Mash some beans** — Into the sofrito for creaminess
6. **Combine and simmer** — Let flavors marry
7. **Salt at the end** — Adjust with vinegar for brightness

- **Chilies are the heart** — Every region has favorites
- **Toast everything** — Chilies, spices, tomatoes

- **Potato worship** — Thousands of varieties

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

1. **Burning dried chilies** — Toast only until fragrant; burnt is bitter
2. **Skipping the blend** — Mole and adobo need to be very smooth
3. **Using old dried chilies** — They should be flexible, not brittle
4. **Over-marinating ceviche** — Traditional is 2-3 minutes, not hours
5. **Wrong limes** — Key limes for Yucatan; regular limes elsewhere
6. **Not frying the paste** — After blending, mole must fry until oil separates
7. **Underseasoning beans** — They can take a lot of salt
8. **Forgetting the finish** — Fresh lime, cilantro, onion at the end

## Cultural Context

Latin American meals are family meals—gathered around the table, multiple generations, food passed and shared. Sundays mean special dishes, all-day cooking, extended family.

Street food culture is strong throughout—tacos in Mexico, anticuchos in Peru, acarajé in Brazil. These aren't lesser foods; they're often the best.

Markets (mercados) are the heart of shopping—fresh produce, specialty ingredients, prepared foods to eat on the spot.

When writing these recipes, honor the time investment. Mole takes all day; black beans take hours; that's not a problem to solve, it's a tradition to respect.

## Recipe Formatting Notes

- Specify regional origin within countries
- Include chili substitutions for hard-to-find varieties
- Note the number of servings generously (these are family dishes)
- Describe proper chili toasting technique
- List traditional garnishes and accompaniments
- Mention which elements improve with time (mole, beans)
- Include pronunciation guides for dish names
