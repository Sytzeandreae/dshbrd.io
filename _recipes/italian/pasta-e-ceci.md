## Pasta e Ceci

*This is poverty food that eats like royalty—a bowl of pasta and chickpeas that has sustained Roman families for generations. The secret is cooking the pasta directly in the chickpea broth, so everything becomes one thing: starchy, creamy, deeply satisfying. Some purists blend part of the chickpeas for creaminess; others leave them whole for texture. I do both. This is the kind of dish that makes you wonder why anyone needs meat.*

**Serves 4 | Prep: 15 min | Cook: 45 min (plus overnight soak if using dried) | Keeps 3 days refrigerated, freezes beautifully**

### Method

**If Using Dried Chickpeas**

1. **Soak chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water.** They'll double in size, so use a large bowl. Drain and rinse before proceeding.

2. **Cover chickpeas with fresh water by 5cm in a pot.** Add the smashed garlic cloves, rosemary sprig, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered until tender but not mushy, 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on the age of your chickpeas. Season with salt only in the last 15 minutes—earlier salting can toughen the skins.

3. **Drain, reserving the cooking liquid.** Remove and discard the garlic, rosemary, and bay leaf. You now have chickpeas and their broth—liquid gold.

**If Using Canned Chickpeas**

1. **Drain and rinse the chickpeas.** You'll use water or light vegetable broth instead of cooking liquid, which works fine. The dish will be slightly less complex but still wonderful.

**Build the Soup**

2. **Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat.** Add the soffritto—onion, carrot, and celery—and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and just beginning to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Don't rush this. The sweetness comes from patience.

3. **Add the anchovies if using.** Stir them into the vegetables and press with a wooden spoon. They'll dissolve into nothing within a minute, leaving only umami behind. No one will know they're there.

4. **Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes.** Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. The garlic should smell sweet, not sharp or brown.

5. **Add the chickpeas and stir to coat.** Let them warm through for 2-3 minutes, absorbing the flavors of the soffritto.

6. **Take about one-third of the chickpeas and blend with 250ml of the cooking liquid (or water/broth).** You can use an immersion blender directly in a portion of the pot, or transfer to a blender. This creates the creamy base without losing all the texture. Return to the pot.

7. **Add enough liquid to cover generously—about 750ml to 1L.** The mixture should be brothy; it will thicken significantly as the pasta cooks. Bring to a simmer.

**Cook the Pasta**

8. **Add the pasta directly to the pot.** Stir well to prevent sticking. This is the Roman way—the pasta cooks in the soup, releasing its starch into the broth, thickening everything into creamy cohesion.

9. **Cook, stirring often, until pasta is al dente.** This takes about 2 minutes less than the package says, since it will continue cooking off heat. Add more liquid if the soup gets too thick—it should flow, not clump. The final texture should be somewhere between soup and stew; Italians call this *minestra*.

10. **Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.** This dish needs more salt than you think. The chickpeas are earthy and can taste flat without it.

**Serve**

11. **Ladle into warm bowls.** Drizzle generously with your best olive oil—the good stuff, raw, where you can taste it. A few grinds of black pepper. Parmigiano if you like, though many Romans consider this heresy.

12. **Let it rest for 2-3 minutes before eating.** Pasta e ceci improves as it sits and continues to thicken. The leftovers tomorrow will be even better—just add a splash of water when reheating.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Chickpeas:** Can be cooked up to 5 days ahead and refrigerated in their broth. The broth is the treasure—don't discard it.
- **Complete soup (without pasta):** Can be made to the point before adding pasta, then refrigerated for up to 3 days.
- **With pasta:** Best eaten within 3 days. The pasta will continue to absorb liquid and soften. Add water or broth when reheating and adjust seasoning.
- **Freezing:** Freeze before adding pasta. The chickpea soup base freezes beautifully for up to 3 months. Thaw, reheat, add pasta fresh.

### Cook's Notes

*On pasta shape:* Romans use ditalini or small tubes that capture the chickpeas. Broken spaghetti (break into 2cm pieces) is also traditional—and thrifty, using up the broken ends of the box. Whatever you use, small is the key.

*On thickness:* This should not be brothy like chicken noodle soup. It should coat the spoon, almost creamy from the blended chickpeas and pasta starch. Italians describe the consistency as "flowing like a wave" when you tilt the bowl.

*On the oil:* The finishing olive oil isn't optional. It's not a garnish—it's an ingredient. Use something you'd drizzle on good bread.

*Regional note:* This version is Roman-ish. Neapolitan versions add a bit of tomato paste; Puglian versions use orecchiette. They're all correct. Adapt as you like.
