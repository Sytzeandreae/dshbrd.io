## Pappardelle al Ragù d'Anatra

*This is Tuscan Sunday cooking at its soul—duck legs braised low and slow until the meat falls away from the bone, shredded and folded into wide ribbons of pappardelle that catch every bit of the dark, wine-rich sauce. The duck fat renders as it cooks, basting the meat and building a ragù of extraordinary depth. Make this when you have an afternoon and the patience to let something become what it's meant to be.*

**Serves 6 | Prep: 30 min | Cook: 3.5 hours (mostly unattended) | Ragù freezes beautifully for 3 months**

### Method

**Brown the Duck**

1. **Season generously and early.** Pat the duck legs dry with paper towels—this is essential for browning. Season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. If you have time, do this an hour ahead and let them sit uncovered in the refrigerator. The salt draws out moisture, which means better browning.

2. **Render the fat, then sear.** Place the duck legs skin-side down in a cold Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot. Turn the heat to medium. **Let them cook undisturbed for 12-15 minutes** as the fat renders and the skin turns deeply golden and crisp. You'll hear sizzling—that's the water evaporating, making room for the Maillard reaction. Flip and sear the flesh side for 3-4 minutes until browned. Transfer to a plate. You should have 3-4 tablespoons of glorious duck fat in the pot—this is your cooking medium now.

**Build the Soffritto**

3. **Sweat the aromatics in the fat.** Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the duck fat (save the rest—it's liquid gold for roasting potatoes). Add the onion, carrots, and celery with a pinch of salt. **Cook over medium heat for 12-15 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until completely soft and just beginning to turn golden at the edges. This is the foundation. The vegetables should melt into each other, sweet and fragrant.

4. **Add the garlic and herbs.** Stir in the garlic, rosemary sprigs, sage, and bay leaves. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant but not browned. You'll smell the herbs release their oils—that's exactly what you want.

**Braise**

5. **Deglaze with wine.** Increase heat to medium-high and pour in the red wine. It will sizzle and steam dramatically. **Scrape up every bit of fond** from the bottom of the pot—this is concentrated flavor. Let the wine reduce by about half, 4-5 minutes, until it smells more of fruit than alcohol.

6. **Add tomato paste and stock.** Stir in the tomato paste, coating the vegetables, and cook for 1 minute to caramelize it slightly. Add the stock and Parmigiano rind if using. Nestle the duck legs back into the pot, skin-side up, partially submerged in the liquid.

7. **Braise low and slow.** Bring to a bare simmer—you want a lazy bubble every few seconds, no more. **Cover and cook for 2.5-3 hours**, checking occasionally to ensure it's not bubbling too vigorously. The duck is ready when:
   - The meat pulls away from the bone with no resistance
   - The flesh is deeply tender but not falling apart completely
   - The braising liquid has reduced and concentrated
   - Your kitchen smells impossibly good

**Shred and Finish the Ragù**

8. **Shred the meat.** Transfer the duck legs to a cutting board. Remove and discard the rosemary stems, bay leaves, and Parmigiano rind. Let the duck cool for 5 minutes, then remove and discard the skin (or save it to crisp in the oven as cook's treat). Pull the meat from the bones, shredding it into rough pieces. Discard the bones.

9. **Marry meat and sauce.** Return the shredded duck to the pot. Stir to combine, breaking up any large pieces. **Simmer uncovered for 10-15 minutes** to let the meat absorb the sauce and everything become one unified ragù. The consistency should be rich and coating—not soupy, not dry. Taste and adjust seasoning. The ragù should be deeply savory, with the wine's fruit notes in the background and the duck fat adding unctuousness.

**Cook the Pasta**

10. **Salt the water properly.** Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt it generously—it should taste like the sea. Add the pappardelle and cook until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package directions. **Reserve 240 ml of pasta water** before draining.

11. **Finish in the sauce.** Add the drained pasta directly to the ragù. Toss vigorously over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, adding splashes of pasta water as needed to help the sauce cling to the wide ribbons. The starch in the water helps emulsify everything. You want each strand coated and glistening.

12. **Serve immediately.** Divide among warmed bowls. Drizzle with your best olive oil, shower with Parmigiano, and scatter parsley if using. Serve with the rest of the wine you cooked with—it's only right.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Ragù (complete through step 9):** This is actually *better* made ahead. The flavors deepen and marry beautifully overnight. Refrigerate for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. The fat will solidify on top—this is fine, it melts back in when you reheat. Warm gently over medium-low heat, adding a splash of stock if needed to loosen.

- **Freezing portions:** Consider freezing in 2-serving portions for easy weeknight dinners. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then reheat gently.

- **Day of serving:** Bring the ragù to a simmer while the pasta water heats. The whole final assembly takes only 15 minutes once the ragù is warm.

- **Duck fat:** That reserved fat keeps for months in the refrigerator. Use it for roasting potatoes, searing vegetables, or making the best fried eggs of your life.

*A note on the wine: Use something you'd actually drink with dinner. The wine's character comes through in the finished dish—a good Chianti or Sangiovese brings that Tuscan authenticity. Avoid anything too tannic or oaky, which can turn bitter during the long braise. And if you find yourself with leftover ragù on pasta on a quiet Tuesday night, warmed through and tossed with fresh pappardelle, you'll understand why Italian grandmothers always made more than they needed.*
