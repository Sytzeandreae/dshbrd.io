## Mushroom Risotto

*Risotto is not a recipe—it's a relationship. You stand at the stove, ladle in hand, and you listen. The rice tells you when it's thirsty, when it's releasing its starch, when it's approaching that moment of perfect creaminess the Italians call "all'onda"—wavy, flowing, alive. This isn't fussy cooking; it's meditative cooking. Thirty minutes of gentle attention, and you're rewarded with something that tastes like it took all day. The mushrooms here are earthy and deep, the Parmesan adds salt and umami, and the finish of butter creates a silkiness that clings to every grain.*

**Serves 4 | Prep: 20 min | Cook: 35 min | Best served immediately**

### Method

**Prepare Your Mise en Place**

1. **Soak dried porcini in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes.** These add an earthy, almost meaty depth that fresh mushrooms can't match. When soft, lift them out (leaving grit behind), chop roughly, and add their soaking liquid to your stock, straining through a fine mesh or coffee filter.

2. **Warm the stock over low heat in a small pot.** Keep it at a gentle simmer throughout cooking. Cold stock shocks the rice and slows cooking—you want each addition to be absorbed almost immediately.

**Sear the Mushrooms**

3. **Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide skillet over high heat.** Wait until the butter foam subsides—this means the water has cooked off and the pan is truly hot.

4. **Add fresh mushrooms in a single layer—work in batches if needed.** Don't touch them for 2-3 minutes. Mushrooms are 90% water; stirring releases moisture and steams instead of sears. You want deep golden-brown edges and concentrated flavor.

5. **Flip, season with salt, add thyme sprigs, and cook another 2 minutes.** Add the chopped porcini in the last minute. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Discard thyme stems.

**Build the Risotto**

6. **In a wide, heavy-bottomed pan (Dutch oven or deep skillet), heat remaining butter and olive oil over medium heat.** Add shallot and cook until soft and translucent, 2-3 minutes. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.

7. **Add the rice and stir to coat every grain in fat.** This is "tostatura"—toasting. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the edges of the grains become slightly translucent but the centers remain opaque. You'll hear a subtle clicking sound. This creates a barrier that helps each grain stay distinct.

8. **Pour in the wine.** It will sizzle and steam dramatically. Stir constantly until the wine is completely absorbed and you can draw a clear line across the pan bottom with your spoon.

**The Dance**

9. **Add warm stock one ladleful at a time (about ½ cup).** Stir frequently—not constantly—allowing each addition to be mostly absorbed before adding the next. The rice should always look loose and slightly soupy, never dry or gluey.

10. **Continue this rhythm for 18-22 minutes.** The risotto is ready when the rice is tender but retains the slightest resistance in the center (al dente), and the overall texture flows like lava when you shake the pan. Taste constantly toward the end—the window between perfect and overcooked is narrow.

**The Mantecatura**

11. **Remove from heat immediately.** Add cold butter cubes and half the Parmesan. Stir vigorously for 30 seconds—this is "mantecatura," the final emulsification that makes risotto creamy without cream. The cold butter creates a glossy, cohesive sauce.

12. **Fold in most of the seared mushrooms.** Taste and adjust salt—Parmesan is salty, so you may need less than you think.

13. **Check consistency.** Proper risotto should flow gently when plated, settling into a pool rather than a mound. If too thick, stir in a splash more warm stock. The Italians call this "all'onda"—it should wave when you shake the plate.

**Serve**

14. **Divide among warm shallow bowls.** Top with remaining mushrooms, more Parmesan, parsley, black pepper, and a drizzle of your best olive oil. Serve immediately—risotto waits for no one.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Partial cooking method:** You can cook risotto 80% of the way (stop adding stock when rice is still quite firm), spread on a sheet pan to cool quickly, then refrigerate. To serve: reheat in a pan with additional stock, stirring constantly, for 5-7 minutes. Finish with butter and cheese. Not quite as good as fresh, but very respectable for entertaining.
- **Mushrooms:** Can be seared up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat briefly in a hot pan before finishing the dish.
- **Stock:** Homemade stock makes a noticeable difference here. Make a batch on the weekend and freeze in 2-cup portions.
- **Leftovers:** Day-old risotto makes excellent arancini—form into balls, stuff with mozzarella if desired, bread, and deep fry until golden.

### Wine Notes

*A note on the wine: Risotto loves acidity—it brightens the dish and keeps each bite from feeling too heavy. Reach for a crisp, dry white: Pinot Grigio brings clean, mineral notes that complement the earthy mushrooms without competing; Sauvignon Blanc adds a hint of herbaceousness that echoes the thyme. Avoid oaky wines—their buttery richness dulls the fresh, bright character you're after. The wine's job here is to deglaze the toasted rice and leave behind its acidity as the alcohol evaporates, so choose something with good backbone. And pour yourself a glass while you stir—risotto rewards the cook who keeps company with good wine.*
