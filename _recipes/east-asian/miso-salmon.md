## Miso Glazed Salmon

*There's a reason this dish appears on every Japanese restaurant menu from Tokyo to Toronto—it's the perfect marriage of technique and ingredient. The miso marinade does something almost miraculous to salmon: it seasons deeply, creates a lacquered caramelized crust, and keeps the flesh impossibly moist. Nobu Matsuhisa made this dish famous, but it belongs to generations of Japanese home cooks. The secret? Time. Even two hours of marinating transforms the fish.*

**Serves 4 | Prep: 10 min | Marinate: 2-48 hours | Cook: 15 min**

### Method

**Build the Marinade**

1. **Whisk together miso, mirin, sake, soy sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil** in a small bowl until smooth. The mixture should be the consistency of thick paint. Taste it—it should be intensely savory-sweet with good depth.

**Marinate the Salmon**

2. **Pat salmon fillets completely dry with paper towels.** Moisture is the enemy of caramelization. Check for pin bones by running your finger along the flesh—remove any with tweezers.

3. **Place salmon in a shallow dish or zip-lock bag.** Pour marinade over the fish, turning to coat all sides. The marinade should cling and coat, not pool.

4. **Refrigerate for minimum 2 hours, ideally overnight, up to 48 hours.** The longer it marinates, the deeper the flavor penetrates and the more the sugars will caramelize. Overnight is the sweet spot—48 hours gives you restaurant-quality depth.

**Cook the Salmon**

5. **Remove salmon from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking.** Cold fish in a hot pan cooks unevenly. Gently scrape off excess marinade—you want a thin coating, not globs. Reserve scraped marinade.

6. **Position oven rack 6 inches from broiler. Preheat broiler to high.** Line a sheet pan with foil and brush lightly with oil.

7. **Place salmon skin-side down on prepared pan.** The skin protects the bottom from overcooking while the top caramelizes.

8. **Broil for 8-12 minutes without flipping.** Watch it carefully after minute 6—the sugars in the miso will caramelize quickly and can go from lacquered to burnt in moments. You want deep amber and black spots, not char. The fish is done when it flakes easily at the thickest part but still looks slightly translucent in the very center (it will carry over).

**Alternative: Pan-Sear Method**

9. **For crispier results, use a hot cast iron skillet.** Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over medium-high until shimmering. Place salmon skin-side up and sear without moving for 3 minutes until deeply caramelized. Flip and cook skin-side down for 3-4 minutes. Finish under broiler for 1-2 minutes to lacquer the top.

**Serve**

10. **Transfer to plates immediately.** Scatter with sliced scallions and sesame seeds. Serve over steamed rice with any remaining marinade brushed on top (boil it first for 2 minutes if using as sauce, to kill any bacteria from the raw fish).

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Marinating:** The marinade is the make-ahead step here. Salmon can sit in marinade for up to 48 hours—this is ideal for weeknight cooking. Prep Sunday, eat Tuesday.
- **Marinade batch:** Double or triple the marinade and store in a jar in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You'll use it constantly—it works on chicken, black cod, tofu, even roasted vegetables.
- **Freezing:** You can freeze salmon in the marinade for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in refrigerator and proceed as directed. The texture may be slightly softer but the flavor will be excellent.
- **Leftover salmon:** Flakes beautifully over rice bowls, in salads, or tucked into rice paper rolls the next day.
