## Miso Ramen (A Complete Guide)

*Ramen is not a recipe—it's a discipline. A bowl of properly made ramen is the sum of its components: a clear, golden broth that took hours to coax from bones and aromatics; a tare so complex it requires three types of miso and time to mature; noodles with that specific alkaline chew; an egg steeped to custard-yolked perfection. Making ramen from scratch is a weekend project, a meditation, a commitment to the idea that some things are worth doing properly. Once you've tasted your own, restaurant ramen will never quite satisfy again.*

**Serves 4 | Prep: 2 hours (spread over 3 days) | Cook: 3 hours | Tare matures: 24+ hours | Noodles rest: 2 days**

---

### Method

This recipe has five components, each prepared separately. Plan to make the tare and noodles 2-3 days ahead, the broth and eggs 1 day ahead, and the aromatic oil any time. Assembly takes 10 minutes once everything is ready.

---

## Component 1: Chintan Broth

*A chintan is a clear soup—not the rich, opaque tonkotsu of Kyushu, but the elegant, amber broth of Sapporo. It should taste clean but deep, with layers of chicken, aromatics, and umami from kombu and shiitake.*

**Make 1-2 days ahead | Refrigerate up to 5 days | Freeze up to 3 months**

1. **Build the base.** Add water, chicken carcasses, onion, carrot, garlic, ginger, and dried shiitake to a large stockpot. The chicken should be submerged.

2. **Simmer gently—never boil.** Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce to a bare simmer, around 95°C. **Boiling makes cloudy broth; simmering keeps it clear and elegant.** Skim any foam that rises in the first 20 minutes.

3. **Let time work.** Simmer uncovered for 2-3 hours. The broth should reduce by about a quarter and turn pale gold. Taste periodically—it should develop depth without becoming murky or heavy.

4. **Finish with kombu and scallions.** When the broth tastes rich and round, add the scallions and kombu. Turn off the heat and let steep for 15 minutes—**no longer, or the kombu turns bitter and slimy.** This final infusion adds that essential ocean-floor umami.

5. **Strain and store.** Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into containers. Don't press on the solids—let it drip naturally for clearest broth. Cool, refrigerate, and scrape off any fat that solidifies. The fat can be saved for the aromatic oil.

---

## Component 2: Miso Tare

*The tare is the soul of ramen—it provides all the seasoning for the bowl. This version uses three types of miso layered with aromatics and fermented complexity. It needs at least 24 hours to mature and mellow.*

**Make 2-3 days ahead | Refrigerate up to 12 months**

1. **Caramelize half the onion.** Take 70g of the raw onion purée and add it to a small pan. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown—20-30 minutes. **This step adds sweetness and complexity that raw onion cannot.** Let cool completely.

2. **Combine everything.** In a large bowl, add the caramelized onion, remaining raw onion, garlic, ginger, all three misos, mirin, soy sauce, sesame oil, tahini, black pepper, doubanjiang, white pepper, and togarashi. Whisk thoroughly until completely combined.

3. **Let it mature.** Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. **This rest mellows the raw aromatics and allows the flavors to marry.** The tare will keep for up to a year—it only improves with time.

4. **Use generously.** For serving, add 60-70g of tare per 350ml of broth. Adjust to taste—different miso brands vary in salinity.

---

## Component 3: Aromatic Oil

*The fat layer floating on top of a bowl of ramen isn't decorative—it carries aroma directly to your nose with each sip, and it keeps the broth hot. This ginger-scented oil is versatile and keeps for months.*

**Make any time | Refrigerate up to 6 months**

1. **Infuse slowly.** Add the oil, onion pieces, garlic, and ginger to a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low, stirring occasionally.

2. **Watch for color.** Cook for about 15 minutes until everything is light golden and the kitchen smells incredible. **Don't rush this—high heat will burn the garlic and turn the oil bitter.**

3. **Cool in the pot.** Remove from heat and let cool completely in the pan—the aromatics continue to infuse as they cool.

4. **Strain and store.** Strain into a jar, pressing gently on the solids. Refrigerate until needed.

## Component 4: Sapporo-Style Noodles

*These are not instant noodles—they have that characteristic alkaline chew, that slight yellow tinge, that springy texture that makes ramen noodles unlike any other. Making them requires precision and patience, but the result is transformative.*

**Make 2-3 days ahead | The rest is non-negotiable**

**Prepare the Alkaline Solution**

1. **If using baking soda,** spread it on a baking sheet and bake at 120°C for 1 hour to convert it to sodium carbonate (this is essential). Let cool. Alternatively, use commercial kansui powder.

2. **Dissolve the alkaline salts.** Add the baked soda (or kansui) and salt to the water. Stir until completely dissolved—this takes patience. **The solution should be completely clear with no gritty sediment.** You can make this a day ahead.

**Make the Dough**

3. **Combine dry ingredients.** In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine flour, wheat gluten, and egg white powder. Run on stir for 30 seconds to aerate.

4. **Add the liquid slowly.** With the mixer running on low, add two-thirds of the alkaline solution in a thin, steady stream. Mix for 3 minutes—the dough will look shaggy and dry.

5. **Add remaining liquid.** Pour in the rest of the solution, mixing for another minute until small clumps form. **It will look too dry—this is correct.** Stop the mixer.

6. **First rest.** Transfer the crumbly mixture to a ziplock bag. Seal and let rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours. **This allows the flour to fully hydrate. Don't skip it.**

**Sheet and Cut**

7. **Knead via lamination.** Using a pasta machine, sheet the dough through the widest setting. Fold in thirds, rotate 90 degrees, and sheet again. Repeat 10-15 times until the dough is smooth and not ragged. **This develops the gluten network that gives the noodles their chew.**

8. **Second rest.** Return to the bag and rest another 30 minutes at room temperature.

9. **Roll to final thickness.** Sheet the dough progressively thinner until about 1.5mm thick, dusting with potato starch or cornstarch to prevent sticking.

10. **Cut the noodles.** Cut into 1.5mm-2mm wide strips. **Compress the noodles gently into a ball, then separate them**—this creates the characteristic wavy, crinkled pattern.

11. **Final rest.** Portion into 140g bundles, bag loosely, and refrigerate for at least 2 days. **This rest is essential—it allows the gluten to relax and the starch to stabilize.** The noodles will be chewy but not tough, with better texture than fresh-cut.

## Component 5: Steeped Eggs (Ajitsuke Tamago)

*The ramen egg—that jammy yolk, that seasoned white—is simpler than you think. The equilibrium method seasons evenly without over-curing, giving you a 1-4 day window of perfection.*

**Make 1-4 days ahead**

1. **Soft-boil perfectly.** Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Lower eggs gently with a spoon. Boil for exactly 6 minutes 30 seconds for a jammy yolk (adjust by 15-30 seconds for altitude). Transfer immediately to an ice bath for 5 minutes.

2. **Peel carefully.** Tap the eggs all over to crackle the shell, then peel under cold running water. Fresh eggs are harder to peel—use eggs at least a week old.

3. **Calculate the brine.** Place peeled eggs in a container. Cover with water and weigh everything (eggs + water). Add 10% of that weight in soy sauce and 8% in mirin. **Example: 500g total = 50g soy + 40g mirin.**

4. **Steep in the fridge.** Let sit for 24 hours minimum, up to 4 days. The eggs will season evenly through equilibrium—no checking, no guesswork.

---

## Assembly

*This is where everything comes together. Mise en place is everything—once the noodles go into the water, you have 90 seconds before they're overcooked. Set up your station completely before you start.*

**Prep time: 10 minutes per bowl | Have everything ready**

**Prepare Your Station**

1. **Preheat your bowl.** Place your serving bowl in a 170°C oven while you prepare, or fill it with boiling water and dump it out just before serving. **A cold bowl saps 20-30°C from your soup instantly.**

2. **Get everything ready.** Slice your toppings. Halve the eggs. Have tare, oil, broth, and a whisk at the ready. Fill your largest pot with water and bring to a rolling boil.

**Cook the Noodles**

3. **Boil rapidly.** Add 140g noodles to the boiling water. Start your timer—fresh noodles take 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Stir immediately to prevent sticking.

4. **While noodles cook, build the bowl.** Add 65g miso tare to your preheated bowl. Add 30ml aromatic oil. Ladle in 350ml hot broth. Whisk vigorously—**the miso must dissolve completely or you'll have flavor pockets.**

5. **Strain thoroughly.** When noodles are done, drain in a mesh strainer and shake vigorously for 5-10 seconds. **Every drop of cooking water dilutes your carefully calibrated broth.** Move fast—exposed noodles get sticky within seconds.

6. **Add noodles to broth.** Slide the noodles into the center of the bowl. Use chopsticks or tongs to lift and fold them into a neat mound—**this "noodle fold" separates the strands and creates a platform for toppings.**

**Top and Serve**

7. **Arrange toppings deliberately.** Place the halved egg at 12 o'clock. Add nori at 2 o'clock (it goes soggy fast, so add last). Scatter scallions over the center. Add any additional toppings (corn, butter, mushrooms, sliced chicken) around the bowl.

8. **Serve immediately.** Ramen waits for no one. The noodles are absorbing broth as you admire your work. The nori is wilting. **Eat now. Talk later.**

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Broth:** Refrigerate up to 5 days, freeze up to 3 months. Reheat gently—don't boil.

- **Miso tare:** Refrigerate up to 12 months. It improves with age.

- **Aromatic oil:** Refrigerate up to 6 months.

- **Noodles:** Must rest 2+ days after making. Use within 5 days of final rest, or freeze portions for up to 2 months. Cook from frozen, adding 30 seconds to cooking time.

- **Eggs:** Best at 24-72 hours. After 5 days, quality declines. Don't freeze.

- **For a ramen night:** Make broth and tare on Saturday. Make noodles and eggs on Sunday. By Wednesday, everything is ready for an effortless 10-minute assembly.

---

### Vegetarian Variation

Omit the chicken carcasses from the broth and double the dried shiitake to 20g. Add 2 tablespoons of white soy sauce or light soy sauce to the finished broth. The result is lighter but still deeply savory—the kombu and mushrooms provide ample umami.

---

*A note on miso: The three-miso blend creates complexity no single miso can achieve. White miso brings sweetness, red miso brings depth, and hatcho miso brings that almost meaty intensity. If you can only find one, use 500g of white or red miso and increase the soy sauce slightly. It won't be the same, but it will still be good. Yamabuki is an excellent brand available online.*
