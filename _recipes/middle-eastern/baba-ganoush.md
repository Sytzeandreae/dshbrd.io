## Baba Ganoush

*The name means "pampered father" or "spoiled daddy" in Arabic—a dish so luscious, so silky, that it would please the most indulged patriarch. The secret is simple but non-negotiable: you must char the eggplant over open flame until the skin is blackened and the flesh collapses into smoky submission. An oven will cook the eggplant, but it will not transform it. The smoke is the soul.*

**Serves 6 as mezze | Prep: 15 min | Cook: 45 min | Keeps 5 days refrigerated**

### Method

**Char the Eggplant**

1. **If using a gas stove:** Place eggplants directly on the burner grates over high flame. If using a grill, place directly on hot grates. If using a broiler (last resort), place on a sheet pan 5cm from the element.

2. **Char until completely blackened on all sides, turning with tongs.** This takes 15-20 minutes on a gas stove, rotating every 4-5 minutes. The skin should be papery, ashy, and cracked. The eggplant should look ruined. When you press it, it should feel completely collapsed—no firmness at all. The flesh inside should be custardy.

3. **Don't be timid.** Undercharred eggplant tastes bitter and vegetal. Properly charred eggplant tastes smoky and sweet. You want the inside to steam in its own juices while the outside turns to carbon. If your smoke detector doesn't go off, you may not have gone far enough.

4. **Transfer to a colander set over a bowl.** Let the eggplants rest for 15-20 minutes until cool enough to handle. Bitter liquid will drain out—discard it.

**Extract the Flesh**

5. **Split each eggplant lengthwise.** Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, leaving the charred skin behind. Some bits of char will come along—this is fine, even desirable. They add to the smoky flavor.

6. **Don't rinse the flesh.** I know the temptation. Resist it. You'd wash away everything good.

7. **Chop the flesh roughly with a knife.** Some people use a food processor, but traditional baba ganoush has texture—creamy but not smooth. Hummus is smooth. This is its rustic, smoky cousin.

**Build the Dip**

8. **In a medium bowl, combine tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and salt.** Whisk until the tahini seizes up and then smooths out into a thick, pale cream. This is the same tahini sauce that underpins hummus—the mother sauce of Levantine cooking.

9. **Taste the tahini base.** It should be aggressively lemony and well-salted. The eggplant will mute everything, so the base needs to be bold.

10. **Add the chopped eggplant and fold together.** Use a fork to mash and combine, but keep some texture. The result should be creamy with visible strands of eggplant—not a uniform purée.

11. **Taste and adjust.** More lemon? Almost certainly. More salt? Probably. More tahini? If you want it richer. The balance should be: smoky first, then nutty tahini, then bright lemon, with garlic in the background. If the eggplant tastes bitter, you didn't char it enough, or the eggplant was old and seedy. There's no fixing this—start again.

**Serve**

12. **Spread onto a shallow bowl or plate.** Use the back of a spoon to create a swoosh with a well in the center.

13. **Pool olive oil in the well.** Be generous—the oil isn't a garnish, it's part of the dish. Scatter with parsley. Dust with sumac if you have it, or a little Aleppo pepper for color.

14. **Serve with warm pita, torn into pieces.** Baba ganoush is a dip, meant to be scooped and shared. It's also wonderful with raw vegetables, grilled meats, or spread on sandwiches.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Charred eggplant flesh:** Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated. The smoky flavor intensifies as it sits.
- **Complete baba ganoush:** Keeps refrigerated for up to 5 days. The flavors meld and improve after a day. Bring to room temperature before serving and add fresh olive oil and herbs.
- **Freezing:** Not recommended. The texture suffers.
- **Leftovers:** Excellent the next day as a sandwich spread, or thinned with a little water as a sauce for grilled vegetables.

### Cook's Notes

*On eggplant selection:* Choose eggplants that feel heavy for their size with tight, glossy skin. Avoid those that feel spongy or have brown spots—they'll be seedy and bitter. Medium-sized globe eggplants are ideal; very large ones tend to be more seedy.

*On tahini:* This is half the dish. Bad tahini—bitter, separated, old—will ruin it. Good tahini (Soom, Al Arz, Seed + Mill, or any Lebanese brand) is pourable and tastes of toasted sesame. If your tahini is bitter, it's oxidized. Buy a new jar.

*On the char:* The over-the-flame method is traditional and best. If you absolutely must use an oven, roast at 230°C/450°F until completely collapsed, about 45 minutes, but know that you're getting roasted eggplant, not charred. Consider finishing under the broiler to develop some char.

*Regional variations:* Lebanese versions tend to be more tahini-forward. Syrian versions sometimes include yogurt. Turkish *patlıcan salatası* adds tomatoes and peppers. They're all beautiful. This is a Levantine middle road.

*On garlic:* Raw garlic is traditional but can be aggressive. For a mellower version, use roasted garlic or reduce the amount. The garlic should whisper, not shout.
