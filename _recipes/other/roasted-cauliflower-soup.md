## Roasted Cauliflower Soup with Curry and Toasted Almonds

*This is the kind of soup that makes you forget cauliflower was ever considered boring. Roasting transforms it—caramelized edges, nutty depth, a sweetness you'd never expect. The curry and cumin add warmth without heat, the almonds bring texture and richness, and a squeeze of lemon at the end lifts everything into perfect balance. It's elegant enough for guests, comforting enough for a Tuesday.*

**Serves 6-8 | Prep: 20 min | Cook: 50 min | Freezes well for 3 months (without cream)**

### Method

**Roast the Cauliflower and Almonds**

1. **Get your oven hot.** Preheat to 425°F (220°C). This high heat is essential—you want caramelization, not steaming.

2. **Roast the cauliflower.** Toss the florets with 2 tablespoons oil and a generous pinch of salt. Spread in a single layer on a large baking sheet—crowding leads to steaming, not browning. Roast for 25-30 minutes, turning once, until deeply golden with charred edges. **These dark spots are flavor—don't be timid.**

3. **Toast the almonds.** On a separate small baking sheet, toast the sliced almonds in the oven for 5-7 minutes until golden and fragrant. Watch them carefully—they go from perfect to burnt quickly. Set aside for garnish.

**Build the Soup**

4. **Sweat the shallots slowly.** In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook gently for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. **You want them soft and sweet, completely translucent—no color.** This patience pays off in silkiness.

5. **Add the garlic and spices.** Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant. Add the curry powder, coriander, and cumin. Stir constantly for 1 minute—**you're blooming the spices, waking up their essential oils.** The kitchen should smell incredible.

6. **Combine and simmer.** Add the roasted cauliflower and enough warm chicken stock to cover generously (about 6-8 cups). Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the cauliflower is completely tender and falling apart.

**Finish and Refine**

7. **Add the richness.** Stir in the cream, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Add the soy sauce—it adds umami depth without making the soup taste Asian. Drop in the butter. Simmer for another 5 minutes.

8. **Blend until silky.** Working in batches, blend the soup until completely smooth. **I mean completely—this should be velvet.** A high-powered blender works best, but an immersion blender will do if you're patient.

9. **Strain for perfection.** For the silkiest result, pass the soup through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids. This step is optional but transforms good soup into restaurant-quality soup.

10. **Taste and adjust.** This is crucial. Add more salt, pepper, lemon juice, or soy sauce as needed. The soup should be rich but bright, warming but not heavy. It should make you want another spoonful immediately.

### To Serve

Ladle into warm bowls. Scatter toasted almonds over each portion—their crunch against the silky soup is essential. A drizzle of good olive oil or a few drops of lemon juice on top wouldn't hurt.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Roasted cauliflower:** Roast up to 2 days ahead. Refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before using.

- **Soup base (without cream):** Make through step 6, blend, and refrigerate up to 4 days or freeze up to 3 months. The flavors will deepen beautifully.

- **Fully finished soup:** Refrigerate up to 4 days. Reheat gently over medium-low heat, adding a splash of stock or cream if it's thickened too much.

- **Freezing:** Freeze the soup *before* adding the cream for best results. After thawing, reheat gently and stir in warm cream to finish.

- **Toasted almonds:** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. Re-crisp in a dry pan if needed.

*A note on straining: I know it feels wasteful to discard anything after blending, but that sieve catches fibrous bits that would make the soup feel rough on your tongue. The difference between a good soup and a great one is often just this one step. Trust me—strain it.*
