## Chicken and Leek Pie

*There's something deeply British about a proper pie—the promise of that golden crust yielding to reveal creamy, savory filling within. This isn't pub food; it's the kind of pie your grandmother made on Sunday, the one that taught you comfort could be an art form. The secret is poaching the chicken directly in the béchamel, so every bite is infused with that silky, stock-enriched sauce. Make these in individual dishes and you'll feel like you're running your own gastropub.*

**Serves 2 (individual 15cm pies) | Prep: 30 min | Cook: 45 min | Freezes unbaked for 3 months**

### Method

**Soften the Vegetables**

1. **Start with the leeks and carrots.** Melt 10g of butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and diced carrots. Sauté gently for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened but not colored. **The leeks should be silky, the carrots just tender when pierced with a knife.** Set aside.

**Build the Béchamel**

2. **Make a proper roux.** In a medium saucepan, melt the 25g butter over medium heat. Add the flour all at once and stir constantly with a whisk for 2-3 minutes. **You're looking for a smooth, pale golden paste that smells faintly nutty—not raw and floury, not brown and bitter.** This is the foundation of everything.

3. **Add the milk gradually.** Take the pan off the heat briefly and pour in about a third of the milk, whisking vigorously. It will seize up—that's fine. Keep whisking until smooth, then add another third, whisk until smooth, then the rest. Return to medium heat.

4. **Cook to proper thickness.** Stir constantly as the sauce comes to a gentle simmer. It will thicken steadily over 5-6 minutes. **Test by coating the back of a spoon—run your finger through the sauce on the spoon; if the line holds clean, it's ready.** The sauce should coat heavily but still flow.

5. **Season deeply.** Crumble in the stock cubes and stir until dissolved. Season with salt and pepper—**remember, this sauce is seasoning the entire filling, so it should taste well-seasoned on its own.** Simmer gently for 2-3 more minutes to let the stock flavor meld.

**Poach the Chicken**

6. **Add vegetables and chicken to the sauce.** Stir in the sautéed leeks and carrots. Add the raw chicken pieces, pressing them gently into the sauce so they're mostly submerged.

7. **Poach low and slow.** Reduce heat to low and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. **The chicken should turn opaque but remain slightly pink in the very center—it will finish cooking in the oven.** Overcooking now means dry chicken later.

8. **Finish with peas.** Stir in the peas at the very end—they only need to warm through and their bright green color will look lovely against the creamy sauce. Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes while you prepare the pastry.

**Assemble the Pies**

9. **Preheat your oven** to 200°C (180°C fan).

10. **Divide the filling.** Spoon the chicken and vegetable mixture evenly between two 15cm ovenproof dishes—ceramic, enamel, or foil pie dishes all work well. The filling should come nearly to the rim.

11. **Top with pastry.** Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut two circles slightly larger than your dishes. Drape over the filling, pressing the edges firmly against the rim of each dish to seal. Trim any excess, then crimp the edges with a fork for a proper seal—**this prevents the filling from bubbling over and the pastry from shrinking away.**

12. **Finish for baking.** Brush the tops generously with beaten egg—**this is what gives you that gorgeous golden sheen.** Cut 2-3 small slits in the center of each pie to let steam escape.

**Bake to Golden Perfection**

13. **Bake until properly golden.** Place the dishes on a baking tray (to catch any drips) and bake for 30-35 minutes. **The pastry should be deeply golden—not pale gold, not blonde—and the filling should be bubbling visibly through the steam vents.** If the pastry browns too quickly, tent loosely with foil.

14. **Rest briefly.** Let the pies rest for 5 minutes before serving—the filling will thicken slightly and you won't burn your mouth on molten béchamel.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Assembled, unbaked:** Cover tightly and refrigerate up to 24 hours, or freeze for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen, adding 15-20 minutes to the cooking time, tenting with foil if the pastry browns too quickly.

- **Filling only:** The filling (without pastry) refrigerates for 3 days or freezes for 3 months. Thaw overnight, top with fresh pastry, and bake as directed.

- **Fully baked:** Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat in a 180°C oven for 15-20 minutes until the filling is bubbling and the pastry has crisped again.

- **Batch cooking:** Double the filling recipe and freeze half in portions. With filling ready, fresh pies are a 40-minute affair on a cold evening.

*A note on pastry: Shortcrust gives you that sturdy, biscuity lid that holds up to the creamy filling. Puff pastry is more dramatic—all those flaky layers—but can go soggy more quickly. If using puff, bake immediately after assembling. If you want to get fancy, cut decorative shapes from the pastry scraps and arrange them on top before egg-washing.*
