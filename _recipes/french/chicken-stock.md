## Classic Chicken Stock

*This isn't cooking—it's alchemy. You're transforming scraps and bones into liquid gold, extracting every whisper of flavor and every strand of collagen until you have something that sets like jelly when cold. That wobble is your proof: you've done it right. Reduce it further and you'll have stock cubes that put anything store-bought to shame—concentrated essence of chicken that brings depth to everything it touches.*

**Makes about 3L stock (or 500ml concentrated) | Prep: 20 min | Cook: 4 hours (unattended) | Freezes beautifully for 6 months**

### Method

**Prepare the Bones**

1. **Start cold—this is non-negotiable.** Place the bones and wings in your largest stockpot. Cover with cold water by about 5 cm. Starting cold allows proteins to dissolve slowly and rise to the surface as scum, giving you a cleaner stock. Hot water traps impurities in the liquid.

2. **Bring to a bare simmer, never a boil.** Set the pot over medium heat. Watch carefully as it heats—you'll see white foam rising to the surface after 30-40 minutes. **Skim this scum patiently** with a ladle or large spoon. A rolling boil emulsifies fat and impurities into the stock, making it cloudy and greasy. You want lazy bubbles, breaking the surface every few seconds. Once it simmers, reduce heat to low.

**Build the Aromatics**

3. **Add the vegetables after skimming.** Once you've skimmed the initial scum (5-10 minutes of skimming is usually enough), add the onions, carrots, celery, and leek if using. Push them down into the liquid.

4. **Add the bouquet garni.** Drop in the thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, and parsley. No salt—you'll season whatever you make with the stock later, and reducing concentrates saltiness.

**The Long Simmer**

5. **Let time do its work.** Maintain that bare simmer—a bubble every second or two—for **3-4 hours**. Don't stir, don't fuss, don't cover. The liquid will slowly reduce and concentrate. Skim any foam that rises, though there shouldn't be much after the first hour. The stock is ready when:
   - It smells deeply savory and aromatic
   - The bones look exhausted, picked clean by the liquid
   - Vegetables are completely soft and giving
   - The color is golden, not pale

6. **Strain with care.** Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl or clean pot. Carefully ladle the stock through—don't dump or press the solids, which releases cloudy particles. Let gravity do the work. Discard the solids; they've given everything.

**Cool and Defat**

7. **Cool quickly for safety.** Set the bowl in an ice bath if you have one, or spread into multiple shallow containers. Stock should be refrigerated within 2 hours. **Never put hot stock directly in the fridge**—it raises the temperature dangerously and takes forever to cool in the center.

8. **Let the fat do its job.** Refrigerate overnight. The fat will solidify into a white disk on top—this actually protects the stock beneath. When you're ready to use or freeze, lift off the fat disk. Save it for cooking if you like (it's delicious for roasting vegetables).

### Reducing for Stock Cubes

**This is where the magic happens.**

9. **Concentrate the essence.** Pour the defatted stock into a wide pan—surface area speeds evaporation. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat and reduce by **5-6x**, until you have about 500ml from your original 3L. This takes 45-60 minutes. The stock will become syrupy and deeply golden. **Watch carefully at the end**—it can go from perfect to burnt quickly once it's concentrated.

10. **Test the set.** Spoon a little onto a cold plate. Refrigerate for 5 minutes. It should set almost solid, like firm jelly. This is the gelatin telling you it's ready—concentrated enough to pack serious body into any dish.

11. **Pour into ice cube trays.** Each cube will be roughly 2 tablespoons of concentrate. Let cool to room temperature, then freeze until solid. Pop the cubes into freezer bags, label with the date.

12. **Use with abandon.** Each cube reconstitutes to about 1 cup of stock when dissolved in hot water—or use straight for intense flavor in risotto, pan sauces, or braises.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Full stock:** Refrigerate up to 5 days (the fat cap helps preserve it). Freeze in various sizes—some 500ml containers for soup, some ice cube trays for pan sauces.

- **Concentrated cubes:** Freeze for up to 6 months. They're so concentrated that freezer burn isn't really an issue.

- **Collecting bones:** Save roast chicken carcasses in a freezer bag. Once you have 2-3 carcasses (1.5-2 kg), you're ready to make stock. This is the secret to always having stock on hand without buying bones.

- **Second extraction (remouillage):** If you're feeling thrifty, cover the strained bones with fresh water and simmer another 2 hours. This "rewetting" makes a lighter stock—not as rich, but good for cooking rice or diluting the concentrated cubes.

### The Science of Great Stock

*A note on gelatin: The wobble in cold stock isn't just satisfying—it's functional. Gelatin gives body to sauces, makes braises silky, and provides that lip-coating richness that water never can. It comes from collagen in connective tissue, which is why wings, backs, and necks make better stock than breast bones. If your stock doesn't gel, add more joints next time—chicken feet are the secret weapon if you can find them.*

*And on clarity: A clear stock isn't just prettier—it tastes cleaner. The scum you skim is coagulated protein and impurities. Left in, they muddy both appearance and flavor. The gentle simmer prevents emulsification, keeping fat separate and easy to remove. It takes patience, but the result is stock so pure it's almost translucent.*
