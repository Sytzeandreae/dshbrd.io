## Thai Larb (Mushroom)

*Larb—sometimes spelled laab or laap—is the national dish of Laos that has become beloved throughout Thailand. Traditionally made with minced meat, this mushroom version captures the essence of the original: intensely sour from lime, salty from fish sauce, fragrant from fresh herbs, and textured by the nutty crunch of toasted rice powder. It's a dish that wakes you up. Every bite delivers something: heat from fresh chilies, cool from mint, crunch from shallots, umami from mushrooms standing in for meat. Eaten wrapped in cool lettuce with sticky rice, it's the kind of food that proves vegetables need no apology.*

**Serves 4 as appetizer, 2 as main | Prep: 20 min | Cook: 15 min | Best fresh, does not store well**

### Method

**Make the Toasted Rice Powder**

1. **Toast the rice dry.** Heat a small pan over medium heat—no oil. Add the raw rice and shake the pan frequently. After 5-8 minutes, the rice will turn golden brown and smell nutty, like popcorn. **Watch carefully in the final minutes—it goes from golden to burned quickly.** Some grains will be darker than others; that's fine.

2. **Grind to powder.** Let the rice cool completely—hot rice won't grind properly. Transfer to a mortar and pestle (traditional) or spice grinder. Pound or pulse until you have a coarse powder. **Don't over-process; you want some texture, not flour.** This powder is called khao khua, and it's essential—it absorbs moisture, adds nuttiness, and gives larb its characteristic sandy texture.

   *Make-ahead: Toasted rice powder keeps in an airtight container for months. Make extra; you'll use it.*

**Prepare the Mushrooms**

3. **Chop for texture.** Finely chop the mushrooms by hand or pulse in a food processor. You want pieces roughly the size of ground meat—uniform, but not paste. **If using a food processor, work in batches and pulse in short bursts.** Mushrooms release water when over-processed.

**Cook the Larb**

4. **Sear the mushrooms hot and fast.** Heat a large wok or skillet over high heat until smoking. Add the oil and immediately add the mushrooms. Spread them out and resist the urge to stir. **Let them sit for 2-3 minutes to develop color and release their moisture.** Then stir and continue cooking until they're deeply browned and any liquid has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes total. **This browning is where the umami develops—don't rush it.**

5. **Remove from heat to dress.** Take the pan off the heat—**this is important.** Larb dressing contains lime juice, which becomes bitter if heated. Let the mushrooms cool for a minute in the pan.

**Build the Salad**

6. **Add the dressing.** To the slightly cooled mushrooms, add the lime juice, fish sauce, and palm sugar. Toss to combine. The residual heat will dissolve the sugar and warm the dressing without cooking it.

7. **Add the aromatics.** Add the minced chilies, sliced shallots, and scallions. Toss again.

8. **Taste and find the balance.** Larb should be:
   - **Aggressively sour** from lime (this is the dominant flavor)
   - **Salty** from fish sauce
   - **Barely sweet** from palm sugar (just enough to round the edges)
   - **Hot** from chilies (as much as you can handle)

   Adjust now. More lime if it tastes flat. More fish sauce if it needs depth. More sugar only if the lime is too sharp. **When it makes your mouth water, it's right.**

9. **Add the rice powder and herbs.** Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the toasted rice powder over the larb and toss. Add the mint, cilantro, and any other fresh herbs. Fold gently—**the herbs should stay vibrant and fresh, not wilted.**

**Serve**

10. **Present properly.** Mound the larb on a plate. Surround with butter lettuce leaves, cucumber slices, and lime wedges. Serve with sticky rice. **To eat: take a ball of sticky rice, wrap it with some larb in a lettuce leaf, and eat in one bite.** The cool lettuce, warm mushrooms, sticky rice, and bright herbs create the perfect single mouthful.

### Variations

- **Larb with tofu:** Press extra-firm tofu, crumble, and sear until golden. Proceed as above.

- **Traditional meat larb:** Replace mushrooms with 500g minced chicken thigh. Cook until just done, breaking up clumps. The method is the same.

- **Larb salad:** Serve over a bed of greens with rice on the side for a lighter meal.

### Notes on Thai Herbs

Fresh herbs are non-negotiable in larb. Each brings something essential:

- **Mint:** Cooling, bright, the most important herb here
- **Cilantro:** Citrusy, fresh—use stems too, they have more flavor than leaves
- **Thai basil:** Anise notes, optional but lovely
- **Culantro (ngò gai, sawtooth herb):** More pungent than cilantro, traditional in Isaan cooking

Buy more herbs than you think you need. In Thailand, the herb plate is as substantial as the main dish.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Toasted rice powder:** Keeps for months in an airtight container at room temperature. Always have some on hand.

- **Mushrooms:** Can be browned up to a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before dressing.

- **Herbs:** Wash and dry ahead of time, but don't chop until serving. Store wrapped in damp paper towels in the refrigerator.

- **The dressed larb:** Does not keep well. The lime juice continues to "cook" the herbs, and the dish becomes soggy. Make and eat immediately.

*A note on fish sauce and vegan options: Fish sauce is the salt of Southeast Asia—it provides not just salinity but depth and umami. For a fully vegan larb, substitute with good soy sauce plus a splash of rice vinegar, or seek out vegan fish sauce (made from seaweed or fermented mushrooms). It won't taste identical, but it will still be delicious. Some Thai cooks add a pinch of MSG to compensate—there's no shame in that.*
