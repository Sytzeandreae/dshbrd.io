## Brothy Red Curry Chicken and Cabbage

*This is the kind of dish that feels like a revelation the first time you make it—all that flavor from one pan, in under an hour. The magic is in the sequence: crispy-skinned chicken renders its fat, charred cabbage picks up the fond, and coconut milk splits deliberately to create a rich, glossy broth that's somehow both light and deeply satisfying. It's Thai grandma wisdom meets French technique, served over rice at 10pm when you need something that nourishes without weighing you down.*

**Serves 2 | Prep: 15 min | Cook: 30 min | Broth freezes well for 2 months**

### Method

**Render and Crisp the Chicken**

1. **Start cold for crispier skin.** Season the chicken thighs generously with salt. Place them skin-side down in a cold pan with the olive oil—this allows the fat to render slowly as the pan heats. Turn the heat to medium and leave them completely alone.

2. **Patience rewards you here.** Cook undisturbed for 12-15 minutes. The skin will release naturally from the pan when it's ready—if it sticks, it needs more time. You're looking for deep golden brown, almost mahogany. **The fond building on the pan bottom is flavor currency—protect it.** Flip and cook another 5-6 minutes until cooked through. Remove and rest on a cutting board.

**Char the Cabbage**

3. **Use the same pan.** Without wiping it out, add the cabbage wedges cut-side down. Turn heat to high. Let them sit and char for 3-4 minutes until the edges blacken and the interior begins to soften. Add a splash of water and cover briefly if the centers need more cooking—**you want char on the outside, tender on the inside.** Remove and set aside with the chicken.

**Build the Broth**

4. **Bloom the aromatics low and slow.** Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the garlic and ginger to the rendered fat in the pan—**watch carefully here, the fond is precious and burns quickly.** Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly.

5. **Toast the curry paste.** Add the red curry paste and cook for another minute, stirring it into the aromatics. The paste will deepen in color and smell intensely aromatic. **This step transforms raw, jarring curry paste into something complex and rounded.**

6. **Split the coconut milk deliberately.** Pour in the coconut milk and stir to scrape up every bit of fond from the bottom. Bring to a boil and keep it there—**you want the coconut milk to break, the fat rising to the surface in red-orange pools.** This takes 3-4 minutes. This isn't a mistake; it's how Thai curries develop their characteristic richness.

7. **Build the brothy base.** Add the chicken stock, fish sauce, sugar, and a good squeeze of lime juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly reduced and the flavors have melded. **Taste now—it should be salty, sweet, sour, and rich in equal measure.** Adjust fish sauce for salt, sugar for sweetness, lime for brightness.

**Serve**

8. **Assemble with intention.** Mound steamed jasmine rice in deep bowls. Nestle a cabbage wedge alongside. Slice the rested chicken thigh and fan it over the rice, skin side up. Ladle the hot broth around and over everything—the rice will drink it up as you eat. Scatter cilantro, scallions, and jalapeño slices over the top. Serve with lime wedges.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **The broth:** Can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated, or frozen for 2 months. The flavors actually improve overnight. Reheat gently before serving.

- **The chicken:** Best freshly seared for crispy skin, but can be cooked ahead and reheated in the broth (skin will soften).

- **The cabbage:** Best fresh, but can be charred ahead and reheated in the broth.

- **For meal prep:** Make a double batch of broth and freeze. Fresh-sear chicken and cabbage when serving—takes only 20 minutes with broth ready.

*A note on curry paste: Not all red curry pastes are equal. Mae Ploy and Maesri are reliable everyday brands. For special occasions, seek out fresh paste from a Thai grocer—the difference is remarkable. Whatever you use, always cook it in fat before adding liquid; raw curry paste tastes metallic and one-dimensional.*
