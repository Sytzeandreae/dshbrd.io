## Thai Green Curry (Gaeng Khiao Wan)

*Gaeng khiao wan—"sweet green curry"—is a study in contradictions. It's fiery yet cooling, rich yet light, intensely spiced yet somehow elegant. The first time I ate it in Bangkok, from a woman cooking over a single burner in her shophouse, I understood that everything I thought I knew about curry was wrong. The green came from fresh chilies, not food coloring. The sweetness was palm sugar playing against fish sauce. The coconut milk wasn't mixed but added in stages, first split to fry the paste, then whole to build the sauce. Every element had purpose. This is that curry, taught as she taught me: through understanding, not just following.*

**Serves 4 | Prep: 25 min | Cook: 30 min | Sauce freezes beautifully for 3 months**

### Method

**Prepare the Coconut Milk**

1. **Don't shake the can.** Open the coconut milk carefully. The thick cream will have risen to the top, the thin water settled below. Scoop out about 80ml of the thick cream and set it aside—**this is your frying medium.** The rest stays in the can for later.

   *Understanding: Coconut cream is nearly 25% fat. When you cook curry paste in pure cream and let it "split," the fat separates and fries the paste properly. This is the secret to Thai curry—the paste isn't just mixed in, it's actually fried. Skip this step and your curry will taste flat and raw.*

**Build the Curry Base**

2. **Fry the cream until it breaks.** Heat a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the thick coconut cream and stir constantly. After 3-4 minutes, you'll see the cream start to look grainy, then suddenly—**pools of green-tinged oil will rise to the surface.** This is the "crack" or "split." The cream has separated into fat and solids. This is exactly what you want.

3. **Bloom the curry paste.** Add the green curry paste to the split cream and stir vigorously. Fry for 2-3 minutes, until intensely fragrant and the paste has darkened slightly. **You should smell green chili, lemongrass, galangal—every element singing.** If the paste starts to stick, add a splash of the thin coconut milk. The paste should look almost dry and oily, not wet.

**Cook the Chicken**

4. **Sear, don't stew.** Add the chicken pieces to the paste. Spread them out and let them sit for a moment to get some color before stirring. Cook for 3-4 minutes, turning the pieces to coat them completely in the fragrant paste. **The chicken should be sealed on the outside but not cooked through—it will finish in the curry.**

**Build the Curry**

5. **Add the thin coconut milk.** Pour in the remaining coconut milk from the can. Add half of the kaffir lime leaves. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes. **Watch it—you want a gentle bubble, not a rolling boil, or the coconut milk will break in the wrong way.**

6. **Add the vegetables in stages.** Add the eggplant first—it takes longest. After 3 minutes, add the bamboo shoots and green beans. Simmer for another 4-5 minutes until the vegetables are just tender and the chicken is cooked through. **The Thai eggplant should be creamy inside but still hold its shape; the green beans should have a slight snap.**

**Season and Finish**

7. **Find the balance.** Add the fish sauce and palm sugar. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Now taste—this is crucial. A proper green curry should be:
   - **Salty** from fish sauce (the backbone)
   - **Sweet** from palm sugar (rounding the heat)
   - **Hot** from the paste (the signature)
   - **Aromatic** from kaffir lime and basil

   Adjust until all four elements are present in equal measure. No single note should dominate. Add more fish sauce for salt, more sugar for sweetness, more paste for heat.

8. **Add the final aromatics.** Remove from heat. Stir in the remaining kaffir lime leaves and the sliced red chilies. Add the Thai basil leaves just before serving—**they should wilt slightly but stay vibrant green.** If you add them too early, they'll turn black and bitter.

**Serve**

9. **Ladle over jasmine rice.** Spoon the curry generously over steamed jasmine rice, making sure each portion gets plenty of sauce, vegetables, and chicken. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing and extra fish sauce for those who want more salt. **In Thailand, curries are soupy, meant to be eaten as sauce with rice—don't reduce it to a thick gravy.**

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **The curry base:** You can cook through step 5 (before adding vegetables) and refrigerate for up to 2 days. The flavors will deepen overnight. Reheat gently and add fresh vegetables when ready to serve.

- **Freezing:** The completed curry (without Thai basil) freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat gently. Add fresh Thai basil when serving.

- **The paste:** Homemade curry paste freezes in ice cube trays for 6 months. Pop out cubes as needed—each cube is roughly 1 tablespoon.

- **Vegetables:** Always add fresh when serving for best texture. Eggplant and green beans don't freeze well.

- **Batch cooking:** Double the recipe easily. The curry reheats beautifully, and having it on hand for weeknight dinners is a gift to your future self.

*A note on curry paste: Good store-bought paste (Mae Ploy, Maesri, or the refrigerated Thai Kitchen brand) will serve you well on weeknights. For special occasions, make your own—the difference is profound. Either way, remember: the paste must be fried, not just stirred in. This single technique separates mediocre curry from memorable curry.*
