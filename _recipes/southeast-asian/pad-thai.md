## Pad Thai

*Everyone knows pad thai, but almost nobody cooks it right at home. The dish was standardized in 1930s Thailand as a nation-building exercise—rice noodles because Thailand grows rice, tamarind for sourness, peanuts for protein. It was designed to be perfectly balanced: sweet, sour, salty, and umami in harmony. Street vendors in Bangkok work over burners that throw flames three feet high, achieving in seconds what takes us minutes. But even with a home burner, you can make pad thai that sings—if you understand the rules. Work fast. Cook in batches. Never crowd the wok. And taste constantly.*

**Serves 2 | Prep: 30 min | Cook: 15 min | Best made fresh, not reheated**

### Method

**Prepare the Noodles**

1. **Soak, don't boil.** Place the dried rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with room temperature water—**not hot water, which will make them gummy.** Soak for 30-45 minutes until pliable but still slightly firm to the bite. They should bend without breaking but still have some resistance. **Drain well and keep them loosely covered with a damp cloth so they don't stick together.**

   *Understanding: The noodles will finish cooking in the wok with the sauce. If you soak them until soft, they'll turn to mush. If they're too stiff, they'll break. The perfect soak is like pasta cooked to very al dente.*

**Make the Sauce**

2. **Build the flavor base.** In a small bowl, combine the tamarind paste, fish sauce, palm sugar, and water. Stir until the sugar dissolves. **Taste it—it should be aggressively sour-sweet-salty.** The flavors mellow when they hit the noodles, so the sauce should seem almost too intense on its own. Adjust the balance now: more tamarind for sour, more sugar for sweet, more fish sauce for salt.

**Mise en Place**

3. **Prepare everything before you start.** Pad thai waits for no one. Have all your ingredients prepped and within arm's reach of the stove:
   - Noodles drained and ready
   - Sauce mixed
   - Chicken sliced
   - Eggs cracked into a small bowl
   - Garlic and shallots together in a small bowl
   - Bean sprouts separated: half for cooking, half for serving
   - Scallions, peanuts, and lime wedges arranged for plating

**Cook the Pad Thai**

4. **Start with high heat.** Heat your wok over the highest heat possible until it just starts to smoke. **In Thailand, woks are heated until they glow.** Your home burner won't achieve this, but you want it as hot as possible.

5. **Cook the chicken first.** Add 1 tablespoon of oil and swirl to coat. Add the chicken strips in a single layer. **Let them sit for 30 seconds to sear before stirring.** Cook for 2-3 minutes until just cooked through but still juicy. Remove and set aside.

6. **Build aromatics.** Add another tablespoon of oil. Add the garlic and shallots and stir-fry for 30 seconds—they should sizzle immediately. If using dried shrimp, tofu, and preserved radish, add them now. Toss for another 30 seconds until fragrant.

7. **Push and make space for eggs.** Push everything to one side of the wok. Add a splash more oil to the cleared space. Crack the eggs directly into the wok and scramble them quickly with your spatula, breaking them into small curds. **Work fast—you want soft, barely set eggs, not rubbery chunks.** Mix the eggs into the aromatics before they overcook.

8. **Add noodles and sauce.** Add the drained noodles to the wok. Pour the sauce over the noodles. **Now work quickly—toss and fold the noodles constantly, using two spatulas if needed.** The noodles will drink up the sauce and finish cooking in about 2 minutes. **Keep them moving or they'll stick and break.**

9. **Return chicken, add half the sprouts.** Add the cooked chicken back to the wok along with half the bean sprouts and the scallion pieces. Toss everything together for another 30 seconds. **The sprouts should wilt slightly but still have crunch.**

10. **Taste and adjust.** Stop. Taste a noodle. The pad thai should be:
    - **Tangy** from tamarind (the dominant note)
    - **Salty** from fish sauce
    - **Sweet** from palm sugar
    - **Savory** from dried shrimp and eggs

    If it tastes flat, add more fish sauce. If too sour, a pinch more sugar. If too sweet, a squeeze of fresh lime.

**Serve Immediately**

11. **Plate and garnish.** Divide between two plates. Top with the remaining fresh bean sprouts, chopped peanuts, and fresh cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, dried chili flakes, and extra fish sauce on the side. **Squeeze the lime over just before eating—the brightness wakes everything up.**

### Notes on Wok Hei

Wok hei—the "breath of the wok"—is that elusive smoky, charred flavor that defines great stir-frying. At home, with weaker burners, you achieve it by:

- **Working in small batches** — Never cook more than 2 portions at once
- **Not stirring constantly** — Let ingredients sit and char before tossing
- **Keeping the wok screaming hot** — If the sizzle stops, stop adding ingredients
- **Moving fast** — The whole cooking process should take under 5 minutes

You may never fully replicate street-vendor wok hei, but you can get close. The slightly charred edges, the smoky whisper in each bite—that's what you're after.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Sauce:** Can be made days ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before using.

- **Prep work:** Slice chicken, soak noodles, chop vegetables up to a few hours ahead. Keep noodles covered with a damp cloth.

- **The dish itself:** Pad thai does not reheat well. The noodles become gummy, the vegetables wilt, the eggs turn rubbery. Cook it fresh and eat it immediately. If you must reheat leftovers, add them to a very hot wok with a splash of water—but know it won't be the same.

- **Scaling up:** If cooking for four, make two separate batches. Crowding the wok is the number one mistake home cooks make with pad thai.

*A note on tamarind: Tamarind paste comes in different concentrations. Block tamarind (the sticky brown type you soak and strain) is the most authentic and flavorful. Jarred concentrate is convenient but varies widely—start with less and taste. The watered-down "tamarind sauce" sold in squeeze bottles is too weak; avoid it. Your pad thai's soul depends on good tamarind.*
