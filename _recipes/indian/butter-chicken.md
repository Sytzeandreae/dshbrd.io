## Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)

*This dish was born in 1950s Delhi, in the kitchen of Moti Mahal, where cooks threw leftover tandoori chicken into a sauce of tomatoes, butter, and cream—and accidentally created one of the most beloved dishes on earth. The genius is in the balance: the char of the chicken against the velvet of the sauce, the warmth of spices tempered by cream, the brightness of tomato smoothed by butter. When made properly, it tastes like a hug from someone who's known you your whole life.*

**Serves 6 | Prep: 30 min + 2-24 hours marinating | Cook: 45 min | Freezes beautifully for 3 months**

### Method

**Marinate the Chicken**

1. **Score and season.** Make shallow cuts in the chicken pieces—this allows the marinade to penetrate deeply. In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, Kashmiri chili, garam masala, cumin, and salt until smooth.

2. **Let time work.** Add the chicken and turn to coat every piece thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. **The longer the better here—the yogurt tenderizes while the spices infuse.** Up to 24 hours is ideal.

**Cook the Chicken**

3. **Get real color.** Remove chicken from marinade, shaking off excess (discard the marinade). Heat a large skillet over high heat—it should be almost smoking. Working in batches, sear the chicken pieces until charred in spots, about 2-3 minutes per side. **Don't crowd the pan—you want char, not steam.** The chicken won't be cooked through; that's fine. Transfer to a plate.

   *Traditional note: In Delhi, this chicken would be cooked in a tandoor, giving it that signature smoky char. Your hottest pan is the home approximation. If you have a grill, even better.*

**Build the Sauce**

4. **Bloom the whole spices.** In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons butter and the oil over medium heat. Add the cardamom, cinnamon, and cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for 30 seconds until fragrant—**you'll smell them bloom, warm and sweet.**

5. **Soften the aromatics.** Add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until soft and just starting to turn golden. Don't rush this—raw onion makes a harsh sauce.

6. **Add tomatoes and spices.** Pour in the canned tomatoes with their juices, crushing them with your hands as they go in (or use the back of a spoon in the pot). Add the Kashmiri chili, paprika, turmeric, and salt. Stir well. Add the water.

7. **Simmer and meld.** Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The tomatoes will break down and the sauce will thicken slightly. It should look rough and rustic at this point—that's right.

8. **Blend to silk.** Remove from heat. Fish out the cardamom pods and cinnamon stick if you can find them (don't worry if you can't). Let cool slightly, then blend until completely smooth. **I mean completely—no chunks, no texture, just velvet.** A traditional sauce is strained through a fine-mesh sieve for ultimate smoothness; I recommend this step, pressing on the solids to extract every bit of flavor.

9. **Finish the sauce.** Return the sauce to the pot over medium-low heat. Stir in the heavy cream, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and honey. **Taste now—this is where you find the balance.** The sauce should be:
   - Rich but not heavy
   - Gently spiced, not fiery
   - Slightly sweet to balance the tomato's acidity
   - Utterly smooth and coating

   Adjust honey, salt, and chili to your taste. The sauce should make you want to drink it from a spoon.

10. **Add the fenugreek.** Crush the kasuri methi between your palms to release its aroma and stir it in. **This single ingredient is what makes butter chicken taste like butter chicken.** It adds an earthy, slightly maple-like depth that nothing else can replicate.

**Bring It Together**

11. **Marry chicken and sauce.** Add the seared chicken pieces to the sauce. Simmer gently for 10-12 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and has absorbed the flavors of the sauce. **Don't boil vigorously—you'll break the cream and toughen the chicken.**

12. **Rest briefly.** Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes. The sauce will thicken slightly and the flavors will settle.

13. **Serve with love.** Spoon into a warm serving bowl. Drizzle with a little extra cream if you like, and scatter fresh cilantro over the top. Serve with basmati rice, warm naan, or both—you'll want something to soak up every drop of that sauce.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Marinated chicken:** Keeps up to 24 hours refrigerated—longer marinating only improves it.

- **Sauce only:** The makhani sauce (without chicken) refrigerates beautifully for 5 days or freezes for 3 months. It actually improves overnight as flavors meld. Reheat gently over low heat, adding a splash of cream if it's thickened too much.

- **Fully assembled:** Refrigerate up to 4 days. The chicken will absorb more sauce as it sits—you may want to add a splash of cream or water when reheating.

- **Freezing:** Freeze the finished dish (chicken and sauce together) for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in refrigerator. Reheat gently over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, adding cream to restore silkiness.

- **Reheating:** Always reheat gently—high heat will break the sauce and toughen the chicken. Add a splash of cream or water to loosen. Finish with fresh cilantro.

- **Batch cooking tip:** Double the sauce recipe and freeze half. It's the time-consuming part; with sauce on hand, weeknight butter chicken becomes a 20-minute affair.

*A note on kasuri methi: You'll find it at any Indian grocery store, or order it online. It keeps for months in an airtight container and transforms not just butter chicken but any creamy curry. Once you know its flavor, you'll recognize it in every great Indian restaurant dish. It's worth seeking out.*
