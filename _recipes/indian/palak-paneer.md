## Palak Paneer

*This is the dish that made me understand Indian vegetarian cooking isn't an afterthought—it's the heart. The spinach should taste of itself, bright and mineral, not buried under cream. The paneer should squeak slightly when you bite it, its mild sweetness a rest for your tongue between the bold, iron-rich bites of green. The kasuri methi at the end—that's the magic. Don't skip it.*

**Serves 4 | Prep: 25 min | Cook: 35 min | Keeps 4 days refrigerated; paneer can get rubbery when frozen**

### Method

**Blanch the Spinach**

1. **Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.** While waiting, prepare a large bowl of ice water and set it nearby. This is crucial—the ice bath is what keeps your spinach vibrant green instead of army drab.

2. **Blanch the spinach in batches for 30-45 seconds.** Don't crowd the pot; the water should stay at a boil. The spinach should wilt completely and turn bright, almost electric green. Any longer and you're cooking out the color and the iron taste that makes this dish sing.

3. **Immediately transfer to ice water.** Use a spider or slotted spoon, shaking off excess water. Let the spinach sit in the ice bath for 2 minutes—this stops the cooking completely. Squeeze dry in small handfuls, wringing out as much water as possible. The spinach should feel like a dense, damp cloth.

4. **Blend to a smooth purée.** Add just enough water (2-3 tablespoons) to help the blender move. You want silk, not chunks. Set aside.

**Sear the Paneer**

5. **Heat 1 tablespoon ghee in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.** Add the paneer cubes in a single layer—don't crowd them. Let them sit undisturbed for 2 minutes until golden on the bottom. Flip and repeat. You're not cooking them through; you're creating a golden crust that will hold up in the sauce. Transfer to a plate.

**Build the Sauce**

6. **Heat 3 tablespoons ghee in a wide pan or kadhai over medium heat.** Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle until fragrant and slightly darkened, about 30 seconds.

7. **Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 6-8 minutes.** Don't brown them here—you want sweetness, not caramelization. Stir occasionally.

8. **Add garlic, ginger, and green chilies.** Cook for 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears and everything smells fragrant. Your kitchen should smell like a promise.

9. **Let this mixture cool slightly, then blend until smooth.** You can add a splash of water to help. This step is optional but traditional—it gives the sauce its characteristic silky texture rather than having bits of onion. Return to the pan.

10. **Add ground coriander, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder.** Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes over medium heat. You're blooming the spices—the raw, dusty smell should transform into something warm and complex. Don't let them burn.

**Bring It Together**

11. **Add the spinach purée and stir well.** Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will thicken slightly and the green will deepen. Add salt now—taste as you go. Spinach loves salt.

12. **Stir in cream if using.** The cream mellows the iron bite of the spinach and adds richness. For a more traditional, punchier version, skip it entirely. Both are correct.

13. **Crush kasuri methi between your palms and add to the pan.** Stir and cook for 1 minute. This dried fenugreek is the ingredient that makes restaurant palak paneer taste like restaurant palak paneer. It's earthy, slightly bitter, utterly essential.

14. **Gently fold in the seared paneer cubes.** Let them warm through in the sauce for 2-3 minutes. Don't stir vigorously—the paneer should stay intact.

15. **Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.** Taste again. Adjust salt if needed. The lemon should brighten without being identifiable—if you can taste lemon, you've added too much.

16. **Serve immediately** with basmati rice or warm naan, the ghee pooling at the edges where it belongs.

### Make-Ahead Notes

- **Spinach purée:** Can be blanched and puréed up to 2 days ahead. Store covered in the refrigerator.
- **Complete sauce (without paneer):** Can be made up to 4 days ahead. The flavors improve overnight.
- **Paneer:** Best seared fresh just before serving. If you must prep ahead, sear and refrigerate, then warm in the sauce for 5 minutes instead of 2.
- **Freezing:** The spinach base (without cream or paneer) freezes well for up to 2 months. Paneer doesn't freeze gracefully—it becomes spongy. Make fresh paneer when you reheat.

### Cook's Notes

*On paneer:* If your paneer is very fresh and soft, you may not need to sear it—just cube and add directly to the sauce. Firmer, store-bought paneer benefits from the sear.

*On heat:* The green chilies provide gentle, building heat. For more intensity, add a slit green chili to the finished dish. For less, seed the chilies before adding.

*On the green:* If your palak paneer comes out brownish, you blanched too long, didn't shock in ice water, or cooked the purée too aggressively. It should be the color of spring.
